A lot of php frameworks out there seem a bit too complicated for someone starting out in developing php. This is geared toward making a php framework that makes it easier to get a site up and running without having to worry about setting up and making proper configuration files and the like. 

It also includes a couple of libaries (listed below with links to them) and couple that I wrote that can help a new programmer with creating a dynamic site with users and the like.
